This code is meant to be a very small step towards a vision system for brick layinh tobots.
It contains no nueural networks for classification, it would come on next steps.
This project does the following functions:
- takes a jpg image of wall as an input.
- does image analysis to detect the bricks in the wall image.
- builds a wall object according to the data extracted from the image analysis.
- can build wall objects given wall dimensions only: hieght and width.
- can compare between a desired destination (numerical wall object), and the actual wall object built from the image.
